  👍 A cinema hall seating arrangement is a great real-world example of a nested for loop.
  ✅ This mimics a real cinema hall seating chart where each seat is identified by its row and seat number.
 * 
 * Outer loop (i) → Represents rows.
 * Inner loop (j) → Represents seats in each row.
 * Each seat is displayed in format [Row-Seat].
